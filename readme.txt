== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**1. What makes SkillTriks different from a traditional LMS plugin?**  
     SkillTriks is a Learning Experience Platform (LXP), not just a Learning Management System. It focuses on learner engagement, skill development, and data-driven personalization rather than only course management. Think of it as learner-first, not admin-first.

**2. Can I use SkillTriks without coding knowledge?**  
     Absolutely. SkillTriks is designed with non-technical users in mind. HR teams, trainers, or department heads can manage content, users, and progress directly from the WordPress dashboard.

**3. Does it support multimedia content in courses?**  
     Yes. You can include text, images, videos, PDFs, and other media formats in lessons to create interactive and rich learning experiences.

**4. Is there any limit to the number of courses or learners?**  
     There are no hard limits imposed by the plugin. You can add unlimited courses and learners. Your performance depends on your WordPress hosting environment.

**5. Can I assign different courses to different teams or departments?**  
     Yes. With the Role-Based Access & User Grouping feature, you'll be able to assign content to specific teams or user groups.

**6. Will SkillTriks work with my existing WordPress theme?**  
     SkillTriks is designed to work with most standard-compliant WordPress themes. For optimal display, you can customize styles using CSS or reach out to your developer team.

**7. Can SkillTriks send notifications to learners?**  
     Yes, we currently send email notifications. However, a more robust Notification & Reminder system potentially including Slack and Microsoft Teams integration is on our roadmap.

**8. Is progress saved automatically for learners?**  
     Yes. Learner progress is saved automatically as they complete lessons and quizzes. They can return at any time and pick up where they left off.

**9. Is the plugin translation-ready?**  
     Yes. SkillTriks supports internationalization and can be translated into other languages using standard .po and .mo files or with translation plugins like Loco Translate.

**10. Can I export performance reports for reviews or compliance?**  
      Reporting and export functionality (PDF/CSV) is a part of the upcoming analytics module. You'll be able to export team-wide and individual performance data.

**11. Is SkillTriks GDPR-compliant?**  
      Since it's fully self-hosted, you maintain full control over learner data. There’s no third-party data processing, giving you greater flexibility to meet GDPR or other regional compliance needs.

      Currently, SkillTriks is open-source and free. A Pro version with advanced features is in planning.

      You can use the Support Forum on WordPress.org.

**16. Is this plugin for small teams or large organizations?**  
      Both. It’s lightweight for startups and scalable for enterprises.

**17. Can learners access personalized learning suggestions?**  
      Yes. With the upcoming Skill Gap feature, each learner will receive more relevant learning suggestions.
